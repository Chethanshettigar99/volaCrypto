# VolaCrypto
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the volatility of cryptocurrencies using statistical and machine learning techniques. It calculates rolling standard deviation, Bollinger Bands, and GARCH-based volatility to detect price fluctuations and provide insights into market trends.

💡 Features
✔ Computes Rolling Standard Deviation as a basic volatility measure
✔ Implements Bollinger Bands to track price movements
✔ Uses GARCH Model to forecast future volatility
✔ Visualizes trends using interactive matplotlib and seaborn charts

📂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:
🔗 Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Historical Dataset
It includes historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for major cryptocurrencies

📊 Outputs & Interpretation
1️⃣ Bollinger Bands Chart – Shows price trends with upper/lower bands to detect potential buy/sell signals.
2️⃣ Volatility Chart – Compares Rolling Standard Deviation with GARCH Model predictions to track market fluctuations.
